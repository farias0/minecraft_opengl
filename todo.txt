- fix raycasting
- delete block animation (shader, transparency, something simple)
- hold to keep adding/deleting block


- rendering performance:
    - frustum culling
    - only load vertex faces that are exposed to the air to the buffer
    - batch rendering?
    - instancing?
    - divide the world in chunks and only render the ones near
    - load all cubes from a chunk into a single vertex buffer
    - greedy meshing?
    - texture atlas?
    

- better terrain generation?
