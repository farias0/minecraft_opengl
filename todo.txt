- natural terrain gen
- player/block collision

- crosshair
- raycasting
- player gravity
- jumping and/or autojumping (for ledges 1 block high)
- delete block animation (shader, transparency, something simple)
- hold to keep adding/deleting block


- performance:
    - frustum culling
    - divide the world in chunks and only render the ones near
    - load all cubes from a chunk into a single vertex buffer
    - only load vertex faces that are exposed to the air to the buffer
    - greedy meshing?
    - texture atlas?
